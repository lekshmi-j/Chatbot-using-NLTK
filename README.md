# Mental Health Chatbot using NLTK

A retrieval-based chatbot built using **NLTK** and **TF-IDF** to answer mental health–related questions.  
The chatbot uses classic NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant response from a curated FAQ corpus.

⚠️ This chatbot is for **educational purposes only** and does **not provide medical advice**.

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how early chatbots worked before large language models (LLMs), using:
- Text preprocessing (NLTK)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Cosine similarity–based retrieval
- Confidence thresholds and fallback handling

The chatbot responds to user queries by finding the most similar question or statement in a mental health FAQ corpus.

##  How It Works

1. The corpus is loaded from `corpus.txt`
2. Text is preprocessed using NLTK:
   - lowercasing
   - tokenization
   - stopword removal
   - lemmatization
3. TF-IDF vectors are created for all corpus sentences
4. User input is vectorized using the same TF-IDF space
5. Cosine similarity is computed between user input and corpus
6. The most similar response is returned
7. If similarity is below a threshold, a fallback response is shown

##  Example Conversation

Mental Health Chatbot
You: I feel stressed and anxious
Bot: stress and anxiety are common and it may help to take short breaks and rest.

You: I feel empty
Bot: feeling empty can be very difficult and painful. you are not alone.

You: bye
Bot: Take care of yourself. You are not alone.

##  How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Run the chatbot
bash
Copy code
python main.py
🧪 Testing & Error Analysis
Random and edge-case inputs were tested

Low-confidence responses were logged

The corpus was improved iteratively based on failures

This reflects real-world NLP development, where data quality matters more than model complexity.
